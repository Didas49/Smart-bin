For the smart bin project, 
we connected the ultrasonic sensor with its pins as follows:
the negative (-) pin to GND, the positive (+) pin to the 5V power on the Arduino,
and the signal (A) pin to analog pin A0.

The servo motor was connected with its power and ground pins to the 5V and GND on the Arduino, 
and the control signal pin to digital pin D9. 

Jumper wires were used to establish these connections, ensuring proper power and data flow between the components
