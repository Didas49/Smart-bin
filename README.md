The Smart bin project is an Arduino-based automated waste bin designed to promote hygiene and convenience.
It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect objects approaching the bin and a servo motor to open and close the lid accordingly. 
The project aims to create a hands-free waste disposal system suitable for public facilities like hospitals.
